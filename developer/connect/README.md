# Connect your AI

Connect an AI you already use to your Membase memory. You need a Memory with material it
has learned; start with the [app quickstart](https://noah-gao.gitbook.io/membase-user-guide/use/getting-started/quickstart)
if you have not made one yet.

Choose a connection method, follow your client's guide, then ask a question about a known
fact in your Memory to verify the result.

## Two ways in

![An AI app connects over MCP and gets read-only access through the consent screen; an AI that runs commands, or your code, uses a developer key at the key's level; both are changed on Connect](figures/two-ways-in.svg)

| | For | How it authenticates | What it gets |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP with consent** | an AI app the person uses: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex, Grok, Kimi, VS Code, Windsurf… | the app discovers OAuth, the browser opens Membase's consent screen, the person ticks the Memories the app may use and whether it may read their profile | `list_containers`, `search_memories` and, when ticked, `get_profile`. Read-only by design. |
| **Skill with a developer key** | an AI that reads pages and runs commands: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor's agent, Kimi Code | a developer key the person minted | the key's access level, up to Full access |

The account owner can change or revoke either connection from the
**Connect** page, and the change applies on the credential's next call.
[Access control](access-control.md) has the rules.

### MCP server address

Paste this into your client’s remote MCP setup:

```text
https://api.app.membase.io/mcp-http
```

The transport is Streamable HTTP. Supported clients open a browser for consent; the
[client guides](#the-pages) show their setup steps. Some clients also accept a developer
key in an Authorization header, with the permissions of that key.

### The skill, in one sentence

Tell the AI:

> Install Membase from https://www.app.membase.io/skill using key mbk_…

That address is the skill's `SKILL.md` with an install preamble. The AI fetches the folder,
keeps the key as `MEMBASE_API_KEY` and calls the REST API with it. Connect's **Skills** tab
writes the sentence for you, key included. An AI that already has Membase MCP tools uses
those and keeps the skill for its rules.

## The pages

Every client page has the same shape: before you start, set up, with a developer key, what it
can do, which Memories it uses, remove it, and what to do when something looks wrong.

| Page | For |
|---|---|
| [ChatGPT](chatgpt.md) | the Plugins dialog, Developer mode if ChatGPT asks for it, per-chat enabling |
| [Claude](claude.md) | the custom connector on claude.ai and the desktop app |
| [Claude Code](claude-code.md) | `claude mcp add`, a key in the header, the skill |
| [Cursor](cursor.md) | `mcp.json`, project or global |
| [Codex](codex.md) | `codex mcp add`, `config.toml`, the IDE extension |
| [Grok](grok.md) | a custom connector on grok.com; no tile of its own, listed under **Other apps** after consent |
| [Kimi Code](kimi-code.md) | `kimi mcp add`; no tile of its own, listed under **Other apps** after consent |
| [Any MCP client](membase-mcp.md) | the server itself: discovery, the header alternative, what `tools/list` shows, the ready-made config files, VS Code, Windsurf, Devin and every client without a page |
| [Access control](access-control.md) | consent vs key, reach, the profile tick, confirmation, revocation |
| [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) | every word and status a client can show, and what to do |

## What connecting looks like

1. The person pastes the URL into the app, or runs the app's `mcp add` command.
2. The app answers with a browser window: Membase's consent card, listing the Memories with a tick each and **Profile access** for the profile.
3. The person presses **Approve access**. The app's tile on Connect says *Authorized · awaiting first use*; its page lists what it **Uses**. An app without a tile in the catalog (Grok, Kimi Code, any other MCP client) appears under **Other apps** once the consent completed, and only then has a page.
4. In a chat, the person asks *"List my Membase containers."* Check that it names the Memory you granted. Then ask about a specific fact from its
   material and check the answer. An empty list means no Memory is switched on for this connection yet.

Connecting is the account's, once. Which Memories an app uses is the Memory's, and the
switch on the app's page and the switch on the Memory's **Use in** card are the same switch.
The Connect page itself, tab by tab, is on [Connect](https://noah-gao.gitbook.io/membase-user-guide/use/manage-your-memory/connect) in
the user guide.
